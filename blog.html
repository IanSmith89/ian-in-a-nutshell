					<h2>WEEK 1: Basics of HTML, CSS, and Git</h2>
					<h3>Friday | October 30, 2015</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>
						After five days in the Full Stack Program, I feel like I am finally starting to grasp some of the "bigger" concepts in web development. I've learned a ton about Git and GitHub, as well as old and new concepts in HTML and CSS.
						Some of the more interesting/useful topics include:
						<ul>
							<li>
								new elements to use instead of divs in HTML5 such as nav, header, section, aside, and footer
							</li>
							<li>
								more clarification about floats and positioning in CSS
							</li>
							<li>
								forking, cloning, pushing, pulling, commiting, etc. with Git
							</li>
							<li>
								creating a dropdown menu using strictly CSS with no divs or lists
							</li>
							<li>
								learning about different workflows and how they fluctuate based on company/development team size
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>BIG CONCEPT FOR THE FUTURE:</strong> responsive design using percentages and viewport widths and heights to allow fluidity
							</li>
						</ul>
						Overall, I am definitely excited for the next 23 weeks, and look forward to progressing into new territory. I haven't run into any concepts (<em>so far</em>) that are too foreign to grasp, but I know that I surely will at some point. I have enjoyed getting to know everyone in class and I'm also eager to see how much everyone else will progress. Based on this first week, it seems like we will learn incredibly valuable information.

					<h2>WEEK 2: Intermediate HTML and CSS, Intro to JavaScript</h2>
					<h3>Friday | November 6, 2015</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>
						The second week in the Full Stack program included our introduction to JavaScript and practice with HTML and CSS using wireframe mockups. We learned about CSS normalizers and resets and were introduced to the basic syntax and usage of JavaScript. Some more notable topics from this week included:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							the power and reasoning behind semantic HTML and overall semantic practices in programming
						</li>
						<li>
							arrays and objects and how to traverse and access deeply nested objects
						</li>
						<li>
							CSS frameworks
						</li>
						<li>
							using built in methods of objects
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>BIG CONCEPT FOR THE FUTURE:</strong> Use the Pomodoro Technique as discussed in Brandon's lightning talk. It works!
						</li>
					</ul>
					This week was a great introduction to the meat of this course and I am very excited for what lies ahead. The lessons have been going awesome and being in class with a room full of thinkers and problem solvers has been great. Looking forward to next week!
