					<h2>WEEK 1: Basics of HTML, CSS, and Git</h2>
					<h3>Friday | October 30, 2015</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>
						After five days in the Full Stack Program, I feel like I am finally starting to grasp some of the "bigger" concepts in web development. I've learned a ton about Git and GitHub, as well as old and new concepts in HTML and CSS.
						Some of the more interesting/useful topics include:
						<ul>
							<li>
								new elements to use instead of divs in HTML5 such as nav, header, section, aside, and footer
							</li>
							<li>
								more clarification about floats and positioning in CSS
							</li>
							<li>
								forking, cloning, pushing, pulling, commiting, etc. with Git
							</li>
							<li>
								creating a dropdown menu using strictly CSS with no divs or lists
							</li>
							<li>
								learning about different workflows and how they fluctuate based on company/development team size
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>BIG CONCEPT FOR THE FUTURE:</strong> responsive design using percentages and viewport widths and heights to allow fluidity
							</li>
						</ul>
						Overall, I am definitely excited for the next 23 weeks, and look forward to progressing into new territory. I haven't run into any concepts (<em>so far</em>) that are too foreign to grasp, but I know that I surely will at some point. I have enjoyed getting to know everyone in class and I'm also eager to see how much everyone else will progress. Based on this first week, it seems like we will learn incredibly valuable information.

					<h2>WEEK 2: Intermediate HTML and CSS, Intro to JavaScript</h2>
					<h3>Friday | November 6, 2015</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>
						The second week in the Full Stack program included our introduction to JavaScript and practice with HTML and CSS using wireframe mockups. We learned about CSS normalizers and resets and were introduced to the basic syntax and usage of JavaScript. Some more notable topics from this week included:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							the power and reasoning behind semantic HTML and overall semantic practices in programming
						</li>
						<li>
							arrays and objects and how to traverse and access deeply nested objects
						</li>
						<li>
							CSS frameworks
						</li>
						<li>
							using built in methods of objects
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>BIG CONCEPT FOR THE FUTURE:</strong> Use the Pomodoro Technique as discussed in Brandon's lightning talk. It works!
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						This week was a great introduction to the meat of this course and I am very excited for what lies ahead. The lessons have been going awesome and being in class with a room full of thinkers and problem solvers has been great. Looking forward to next week!

					<h2>WEEK 3: Intro to the DOM, Bootstrap, and Functions, Functions, Functions </h2>
					<h3>Friday | November 13, 2015</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>
						This week was full of new topics and included a great intro to naviagting and using the DOM as well as Twitter Bootstrap. We got plenty of practice with higher-order functions and we solidified the concepts from the week with our Crush Code assignment to make a simple pixel art program. My favorite topics this week were:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							learning about the built in methods of objects and functions
						</li>
						<li>
							using the DOM to create, manipulate, and navigate through the various nodes and elements in the DOM
						</li>
						<li>
							the power of higher-order functions, closure, and callbacks
						</li>
						<li>
							the intricacies of UI design with Galvanize member, Jochen Wolters
						</li>
						<li>
							JavaScript events and event handlers
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>BIG CONCEPT FOR THE FUTURE:</strong> Twitter Bootstrap is amazing! Using the grid system and built in styles, mocking up/building projects takes half the time.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The topics from this week were incredibly powerful and informative. I really enjoyed learning about Bootstrap and look forward to more lessons about the interaction of all the topics we've covered so far. It's really incredible to see the multiple ways that developers solve problems.

					<h2>WEEK 4: jQuery, AJAX, Agile Development, and HTML Forms</h2>
					<h3>Friday | November 20, 2015</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>
						Many of the topics covered this week seem like incredibly useful and powerful tools to continue learning about. We discussed an Agile development workflow and practiced using all the various input types and their various usages. Our first day to work in class on our personal frontend projects was today and everyone seems to have great ideas. The most useful lessons we discussed this week included:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							using asynchronous code to perform mulitple tasks with AJAX,specifically with the get method
						</li>
						<li>
							the availability of shorter and more semantic syntax with jQuery to navigate the DOM
						</li>
						<li>
							introduction to the usage of a test driven programming environments and the Agile workflow
						</li>
						<li>
							LocalStorage and the options for saving input information in key/value object
						</li>
						<li>
							the benefit of using the Pivotal Tracker to help the development process
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>BIG CONCEPT FOR THE FUTURE:</strong> The possibilities from input values and their connection with AJAX. Their ability to be handled as events to make asynchronous calls to external API's is one of my favorite topics covered so far in Full Stack.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						I am super excited to start on our individual projects and to make our first truly and unique and functional application. Everything we learned this week really helped solidify the previous material. After this week, I feel confident in effectively using all the tools we've gained to start creating and building web apps.

					<h2>WEEK 5: Individual Frontend Projects and Presentations</h2>
					<h3>Wednesday | November 25, 2015</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>
						This week, shortened for Thanksgiving, was solely devoted to working on our individual projects with presentations taking place this afternoon. Throughout developing my application, I learned so many valuable techniques and processes for communicating with APIâ€™s and going through the full development process was also educational. I am excited to have finished my first project and really enjoyed seeing the unique ways that others solve coding problems in their own apps. My favorite takeaways from this week were:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							using the Google Maps API and the availability of their incredibly precise and helpful documentation, the possibilities!
						</li>
						<li>
							former gSchool graduate, Teddi Maull (g7), came and spoke to us about Confidence and Competence in coding
						</li>
						<li>
							the development process for my personal project went very well and I especially enjoyed the simplicity of styling with Bootstrap
						</li>
						<li>
							Google Fonts API = awesome and simple
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>BIG CONCEPT FOR THE FUTURE:</strong> Take Teddi's advice. "Even if you CRUSH CODE too hard, you can't think. Take breaks." Also, from her husband, Keith Maull, "Accept the fact that what you know <em>will</em> change, and don't be afraid of that. Be constantly ready to learn."
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						This week was definitely intense but I really enjoyed the result and reflecting on the overall process. It was challenging yet fun to combine all the ideas and topics we have covered so far into one application that we can continue to develop and grow.
