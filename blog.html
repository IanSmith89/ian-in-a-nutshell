					<h2>WEEK 1: Basics of HTML, CSS, and Git</h2>
					<h3>Friday | October 30, 2015</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>
						After five days in the Full Stack Program, I feel like I am finally starting to grasp some of the "bigger" concepts in web development. I've learned a ton about Git and GitHub, as well as old and new concepts in HTML and CSS. Some of the more interesting/useful topics include:
					</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								new elements to use instead of divs in HTML5 such as nav, header, section, aside, and footer
							</li>
							<li>
								more clarification about floats and positioning in CSS
							</li>
							<li>
								forking, cloning, pushing, pulling, commiting, etc. with Git
							</li>
							<li>
								creating a dropdown menu using strictly CSS with no divs or lists
							</li>
							<li>
								learning about different workflows and how they fluctuate based on company/development team size
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>BIG CONCEPT FOR THE FUTURE:</strong> responsive design using percentages and viewport widths and heights to allow fluidity
							</li>
						</ul>
					<p>
						Overall, I am definitely excited for the next 23 weeks, and look forward to progressing into new territory. I haven't run into any concepts (<em>so far</em>) that are too foreign to grasp, but I know that I surely will at some point. I have enjoyed getting to know everyone in class and I'm also eager to see how much everyone else will progress. Based on this first week, it seems like we will learn incredibly valuable information.

					<h3>Friday | November 6, 2015</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>
						The second week in the Full Stack program included our introduction to JavaScript and practice with HTML and CSS using wireframe mockups. We learned about CSS normalizers and resets and were introduced to the basic syntax and usage of JavaScript. Some more notable topics from this week included:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							the power and reasoning behind semantic HTML and overall semantic practices in programming
						</li>
						<li>
							arrays and objects and how to traverse and access deeply nested objects
						</li>
						<li>
							CSS frameworks
						</li>
						<li>
							using built in methods of objects
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>BIG CONCEPT FOR THE FUTURE:</strong> Use the Pomodoro Technique as discussed in Brandon's lightning talk. It works!
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						This week was a great introduction to the meat of this course and I am very excited for what lies ahead. The lessons have been going awesome and being in class with a room full of thinkers and problem solvers has been great. Looking forward to next week!

					<h2>WEEK 3: Intro to the DOM, Bootstrap, and Functions, Functions, Functions </h2>
					<h3>Friday | November 13, 2015</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>
						This week was full of new topics and included a great intro to navigating and using the DOM as well as Twitter Bootstrap. We got plenty of practice with higher-order functions and we solidified the concepts from the week with our Crush Code assignment to make a simple pixel art program. My favorite topics this week were:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							learning about the built in methods of objects and functions
						</li>
						<li>
							using the DOM to create, manipulate, and navigate through the various nodes and elements in the DOM
						</li>
						<li>
							the power of higher-order functions, closure, and callbacks
						</li>
						<li>
							the intricacies of UI design with Galvanize member, Jochen Wolters
						</li>
						<li>
							JavaScript events and event handlers
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>BIG CONCEPT FOR THE FUTURE:</strong> Twitter Bootstrap is amazing! Using the grid system and built in styles, mocking up/building projects takes half the time.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The topics from this week were incredibly powerful and informative. I really enjoyed learning about Bootstrap and look forward to more lessons about the interaction of all the topics we've covered so far. It's really incredible to see the multiple ways that developers solve problems.

					<h2>WEEK 4: jQuery, AJAX, Agile Development, and HTML Forms</h2>
					<h3>Friday | November 20, 2015</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>
						Many of the topics covered this week seem like incredibly useful and powerful tools to continue learning about. We discussed an Agile development workflow and practiced using all the various input types and their various usages. Our first day to work in class on our personal frontend projects was today and everyone seems to have great ideas. The most useful lessons we discussed this week included:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							using asynchronous code to perform mulitple tasks with AJAX,specifically with the get method
						</li>
						<li>
							the availability of shorter and more semantic syntax with jQuery to navigate the DOM
						</li>
						<li>
							introduction to the usage of a test driven programming environments and the Agile workflow
						</li>
						<li>
							LocalStorage and the options for saving input information in key/value object
						</li>
						<li>
							the benefit of using the Pivotal Tracker to help the development process
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>BIG CONCEPT FOR THE FUTURE:</strong> The possibilities from input values and their connection with AJAX. Their ability to be handled as events to make asynchronous calls to external API's is one of my favorite topics covered so far in Full Stack.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						I am super excited to start on our individual projects and to make our first truly and unique and functional application. Everything we learned this week really helped solidify the previous material. After this week, I feel confident in effectively using all the tools we've gained to start creating and building web apps.

					<h2>WEEK 5: Individual Frontend Projects and Presentations</h2>
					<h3>Wednesday | November 25, 2015</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>
						This week, shortened for Thanksgiving, was solely devoted to working on our individual projects with presentations taking place this afternoon. Throughout developing my application, I learned so many valuable techniques and processes for communicating with API’s and going through the full development process was also educational. I am excited to have finished my first project and really enjoyed seeing the unique ways that others solve coding problems in their own apps. My favorite takeaways from this week were:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							using the Google Maps API and the availability of their incredibly precise and helpful documentation, the possibilities!
						</li>
						<li>
							former gSchool graduate, Teddi Maull (g7), came and spoke to us about Confidence and Competence in coding
						</li>
						<li>
							the development process for my personal project went very well and I especially enjoyed the simplicity of styling with Bootstrap
						</li>
						<li>
							Google Fonts API = awesome and simple
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>BIG CONCEPT FOR THE FUTURE:</strong> Take Teddi's advice. "When you CRUSH CODE too hard, you can't think. Take breaks." Also, from her husband, Keith Maull, "Accept the fact that what you know <em>will</em> change, and don't be afraid of that. Be constantly ready to learn."
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						This week was definitely intense but I really enjoyed the result and reflecting on the overall process. It was challenging yet fun to combine all the ideas and topics we have covered so far into one application that we can continue to develop and grow.

					<h2>WEEK 6: Intro to OOP and Node.js</h2>
					<h3>Friday | December 4, 2015</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>
						The concepts covered this week included an intro to Node and the power of modularized code as well as an introduction to the four pillars of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). Although the material this week was fairly dense and took a couple of days to make sense of, it’s nice to start connecting the frontend concepts we’ve learned so far with some incredibly useful backend practices. The most interesting topics from this week were:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							grouping objects by similar properties and encapsulating them in functions or object constructors
						</li>
						<li>
							using closure constructors to pass inherited states and behaviors to subsequent children objects
						</li>
						<li>
							abstracting away small details and focusing on larger themes when thinking about grouping objects and functions
						</li>
						<li>
							the ability to override inheritance and assign new implementations of methods for individual objects, or polymorphism
						</li>
						<li>
							Returning interfaces from closure constructors and creating local scope states that the user cannot mutate
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>BIG CONCEPT FOR THE FUTURE:</strong> The ability to use JavaScript on the Command Line with Node.js and access to the huge number of packages available in NPM
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						It's really amazing how much I have learned over the last month and a half. The big abstract concepts of OOP were really enjoyable to try wrapping my head around, and I'm excited to start employing the constructors we learned about. Once again this week, everyone killed it and took the material in stride. I look forward to next week!

					<h2>WEEK 7: OOP, Prototypical Inheritance, Modules, and Intro to MongoDB</h2>
					<h3>Friday | December 11, 2015</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>
						We started off the week with some more practice with Object Oriented Programming and learned about the three types of modules we'll work with for now. We learned how to use prototypical inheritance to construct objects and were introduced to the syntax and structure of Mongo DB. The week concluded with a really fun exercise in creating servers and assigning routes that used CRUD operations to mutate a database via url parsing. The most interesting topics from this week were:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							the four different types of binding for the 'this' keyword: new, explicit, implicit, and regular
 						</li>
						<li>
							using modules to help add structure to your code while saving space and time with three types of modules: Core Modules, File Modules, and node_modules
						</li>
						<li>
							creating constructors thats save memory using protoype chains to check for methods and inherited properties
						</li>
						<li>
							CRUD operations (create, read/retrieve, update, delete) with MongoDB and node modules such as http, url, and monk
						</li>
						<li>
							I can now build a full website with completely designed frontend and a backend database that can store information based on user input!
						</li>
						<li>
							building a server that handles routing using Node
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>BIG CONCEPT FOR THE FUTURE:</strong> The Node Package Manager (NPM) has a <em>ton</em> of great built in packages that are part of Node and give developers access to a vast amount of time-saving code
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						This week was especially fun because we are starting to connect what we have learned on the frontend to backend server side processes. It was also really great to watch the live stream of the capstone project presentations for g11 at the Denver Golden Triangle campus. Their projects were incredible and it was encouraging to see essentially where our class will be in a few months. I definitely understood how some of the projects worked but still feel like there's a lot to learn and I couldn't be more excited about that!
