This is my personal website to track my development through my time in the Galvanize Full Stack program. It also has a little bit of a bio and list of goals for my career in web development. I built this site as a prerequisite for the class and have continued to update the blog weekly. Throughout the program I plan on regularly updating the code using topics and languages we will cover in class.
